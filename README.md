# Team-14 Project
# What we are making

##### This project will consist of a dentist registry booking system. Users will be able to browse and filter appointement to fit their medical needs. The user interface will be found inside the client branch. 

##### The interface is a simple web application, where users will be able to navigate a map marked with available dentist clinics. Upon clicking on of these clinics a booking form with a calender will appear, and let users fill in necessary information to ultimately book their appointment. Bookings are successful if the client recieves a booking confirmation. 
 

# How we are making it:

#### The project will consist of multiple technologies, which will work together to form a distributed system. The technologies are the following. 
- Node.js Express framework for server implementation written in JavaScript 
- Client written in Node.js with the Vue framework to achieve a reactive user interface.
- Local Mosquitto MQTT broker to handle messages sent and recieved by both the client and server.
- MongoDB as the persistence layer for all these components. Database schema will be created through the Mongoose framework.
